Dear Sir/Ma'am,

First of all thank you so much for giving me task.

we are given a task to minimise the distance i.e. we'e looking to move into a new apartment on specific street in such a way that to minimize the farthest distance we'd have to walk from our apartment to reach any of our required buildings.

for this problem, what we are going to do is that we will check our requirements in each block 
if our requirements is full filled by any of the block we will return the block location 
else we will return that block which full fill our requirement most.



fist count the required building in each block

const matchCount = findMatch(blocks[i], reqs)

function findMatch(block, reqs) {

    let totalMatch = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < reqs.length; i++)
        if (block[reqs[i]])
            totalMatch++;

    return totalMatch;
}


Now check if matchCount is equals to reqs(required buildings)
    if equals then we get out required buildings

     if (matchCount === reqs.length)
            return i


    if not equals then store the matchCount and index(building location) and compare with next block 
    if next block contains greater matchCount then replace the previous matchCount and index

     else if (matchCount > bestMatch) {
            bestMatch = matchCount
            index = i
        }


when we check all block then return best match building location and in that building we'd have to walk less as compare to other buildings.
return index


Sample Data used
let blocks = [
    {
        "gym": false,
        "school": true,
        "store": true,
    },
    {
        "gym": true,
        "school": false,
        "store": false,
    },
    {
        "gym": true,
        "school": true,
        "store": true,
    },
    {
        "gym": false,
        "school": true,
        "store": false,
    },
    {
        "gym": false,
        "school": true,
        "store": true,
    }
]
let reqs = ["gym", "school", "store"]


console.log(apartmentHunting(blocks, reqs))

Sample Output
2// at index 2, At index 2, we'd have to walk less as compare to others, and we can optimize your life.
